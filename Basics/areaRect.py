Program to calculate the area of rectangle
Input:
Width = 10, Height = 5  
Output:
Area of Rectangle = Width * Height
                  = 10 * 5
                  = 50
algorithm: 
Step1: define and initilize width, height
Step2: create variable named area and calculate area and calculate area by w*h
Step3: Print area
